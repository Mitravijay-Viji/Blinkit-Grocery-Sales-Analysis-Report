# Blinkit-Grocery-Sales-Analysis-Report
**Project Overview**

   
**Objective:** To analyze Blinkit Sales performance across product categories, fat content, outlets, and geographical regions, providing actionable insights for revenue optimization and customer demand forecasting.

**Tool Used:** Power BI (Data Visualization & Dashboarding)

1. **Key Metrics Analysed**
•	Total Sales Revenue

•	Average Sales per Product

•	Sales by Outlet Size & Type

•	Category-wise Contribution to Revenue

•	Top Performing Products & Underperformers

2. **Total Sales by Fat Content**
   
**Objective:** Analyse the impact of fat content on total sales.

**Analysis:**

•	Regular items contributed the most to sales (~$776K).

•	Low-fat items generated ~$425K.

•	Customers clearly prefer regular items, though low-fat items still contribute significantly (approx. 35%).

**Recommendation:**

•	Continue focusing on regular items as the primary sales driver.

•	Expand the low-fat product line with targeted marketing campaigns to attract health-conscious customers.

3. **Total Sales by Item Type**
   
**Objective:** Identify performance of different item types.

**Analysis:**

•	Top-performing categories: Fruits & Vegetables ($0.18M), and Household (~$0.14M).

•	Low-performing categories: Breakfast Items, Starchy Foods, and Hard Drinks.

 **Recommendation:**
 
•	Allocate more resources (marketing, inventory, promotions) to top-performing categories.

•	For underperforming categories, explore bundling strategies or discounts to boost demand.

4. **Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales**
   
**Objective:** Compare sales across outlets segmented by fat content.

**Analysis:**

•	Across all outlet types, Regular products consistently outperform Low-Fat products.

•	The trend is consistent regardless of outlet size or location.

 **Recommendation:**
 
•	Outlets should keep more stock of regular products while experimenting with health-focused sections for low-fat items.

•	Segment customer base (urban outlets may respond better to low-fat offerings).

5. **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment**
    
**Objective:** Evaluate how outlet establishment year influences sales.

**Analysis:**

•	Outlets established between 2018–2020 performed the best (~$205K).

•	Sales dip slightly after 2020, likely due to COVID-related business impact.

 **Recommendation:**
 
•	Support newer outlets (post-2020) with aggressive marketing and promotions.

•	Study operational practices of 2018–2020 outlets to replicate their success.

6. **Sales by Outlet Size**
    
**Objective:** Analyse correlation between outlet size and sales.

**Analysis:**

•	Medium outlets are the most profitable (~$508K).

•	High-size outlets follow closely (~$445K).

•	Small outlets lag behind (~$249K).

**Recommendation:**

•	Medium outlets should be the standard model for expansion.

•	Small outlets may need restructuring or relocation to increase profitability.

7. **Sales by Outlet Location (Tier)**
   
**Objective**: Assess geographic distribution of sales.

**Analysis:**

•	Tier 3 cities surprisingly lead (~$472K).

•	Tier 2 cities: ~$393K.

•	Tier 1 cities: ~$336K.

**Recommendation:**

•	Increase investments in Tier 3 cities, as demand is higher in smaller towns.

•	Develop city-specific marketing for Tier 1 (premium offerings, urban-focused products).

8. **All Metrics by Outlet Type**
    
**Objective:** Provide a comprehensive KPI view (Total Sales, Avg Sales, No. of Items, Avg Rating).

**Analysis:**

•	Supermarket Type3: Best performer (~$728K).

•	Supermarket Type1 & 2: Contribute moderately.

•	Grocery Stores: Lowest contribution (~$152K).

•	Customer rating: Average 3.9, shows moderate satisfaction.

**Recommendation**:

•	Expand Supermarket Type3 model to other locations.

•	Grocery Stores need modernization (digital payments, better assortment).

•	Improve customer experience to raise ratings above 4.0.

**Overall Conclusion**

**The Blinkit analysis highlights:**

•	Regular products + medium outlets in Tier 3 cities + Supermarket Type3 format = strongest success formula.

•	Growth opportunities exist in low-fat products, small outlets, and underperforming categories.

•	Focus should be on customer experience and targeted category promotions to scale further.
